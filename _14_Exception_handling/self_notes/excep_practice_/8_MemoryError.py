"""
Python Memory Error or in layman language is exactly what it means, you have run out of memory in your RAM for your
code to execute.

When this error occurs it is likely because you have loaded the entire data into memory. For large datasets, you will
want to use batch processing. Instead of loading your entire dataset into memory you should keep your data in your hard drive and access it in batches.

A memory error means that your program has run out of memory. This means that your program somehow creates too many
objects. In your example_1, you have to look for parts of your algorithm that could be consuming a lot of memory.

If an operation runs out of memory it is known as memory error.
