"""
Considered to be a high-performance Python web framework, FastAPI finds extensive usage in the design and development
    of web applications. Released in 2018, this Python framework has garnered huge attention among the developers.

Technically, FastAPI is based on the Starlette framework accounting for quick development and quicker deployment.
    Besides, the framework facilitates automatic OpenAPI validation as well as documentation. Experts consider this
    to be a game-changer in the development space, offering a wealth of opportunities to create feature-rich web
    applications.


Features of FastAPI


Here are some of the key features that makes FastAPI one of the best Python web frameworks to date:


High Performance: FastAPI, as compared to other python web frameworks, has better performance. The fact that FastAPI is
    a speed-oriented framework, it ranks high. Leveraging Starlette features, building APIs and production-ready codes,
    everything boils up to higher speed and improved performance.

Fast to code: With production-ready code, developers need not create anything from scratch. This expedites the process
    by about 200% to 300%. To elaborate, FastAPI uses Starlette to run and offers a lot more features helpful when
    building APIs for serialisation and/or data validation. This reduces the time required to code as the framework
    has everything prepared in advance.

Minimal bugs: Since the framework comes with an auto-completion feature, most of the code is automatically fed into the
    piece. This reduces all possibilities of error, enhancing the quality of output.

Easy-to-understand: FastAPI isn’t anything but Modern Python. There is no new syntax and is basically an advanced
version of Python 3.6. Meaning that anyone with a significant understanding of the language can work on the framework.

Simple Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI documentation with no effort from the developer. The same
    can be located under the application’s/doc path. The documentation has detailed information on the endpoints of API,
    returned codes, response and parameters, etc.

Editor-support: The entire framework is designed keeping in mind autocompletion. It is both simple, and easy to use,
    empowering developers with production-ready code. The automatic interactive documentation further allows testing
    the code directly from the browser.

Based on open standards: One of the biggest advantages of having FastAPI as a Python web framework is its open
standards.  That is, the framework is fully compatible with OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger), facilitating the
creation of APIs (in addition to parameter declaration, body requests, etc) and JSON Schema accounting for automated
documentation of the data model.


When should you choose FastAPI over Flask/Django


Even though FastAPI is a recently-created Python web framework, it seems to have gathered tremendous support from
developers across the globe. Primary reasons include:

Native async support: Since the FastAPI web framework is used for the creation of ML instances and applications, the
native async support eliminates inference latency.

Improved latency: Being a high-performance framework, the overall latency identified for the framework is better as
compared to Flask and Django.

Production-ready codes: Coming with auto validation, and short defaults, with FastAPI web framework, developers have
the ease to build web applications without modifying the code.

High Performance: Compatible with Starlette and Pydantic, developers have access to their core features. Needless to
state that Pydantic is one of the fastest libraries and hence, the overall performance improves, making FastAPI the
choice for web development.

Simpler learning curve: As a minimalistic web framework, learning and understanding the same is pretty easy.


Where Django is your go-to framework when you are planning to build full-stack websites, Flask is ideal for ML engineers
striving to build web models. But if you are looking for a framework that offers both speed and scalability, FastAPI is
the best bet. This is the reason why there has been a surge in the demand for FastAPI developers, creating a pool of
career opportunities. If you are planning to pursue your career as a Python developer, plunging into the framework
might help you make a difference.
