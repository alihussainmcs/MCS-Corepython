"""Comparison or Relational Operators:

Compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them.
They are also called Comparison or Relational operators.


a = 21
b = 10
c = 0

1. if ( a == b ):
   print "Line 1 - a is equal to b"
else:
   print "Line 1 - a is not equal to b"

2. if ( a != b ):
   print "Line 2 - a is not equal to b"
else:
   print "Line 2 - a is equal to b"

3. if ( a <> b ):
   print "Line 3 - a is not equal to b"
else:
   print "Line 3 - a is equal to b"

4. if ( a < b ):
   print "Line 4 - a is less than b"
else:
   print "Line 4 - a is not less than b"

5. if ( a > b ):
   print "Line 5 - a is greater than b"
else:
   print "Line 5 - a is not greater than b"

a = 5;
b = 20;
6. if ( a <= b ):
   print "Line 6 - a is either less than or equal to  b"
else:
   print "Line 6 - a is neither less than nor equal to  b"

7. if ( b >= a ):
   print "Line 7 - b is either greater than  or equal to b"
else:
   print "Line 7 - b is neither greater than  nor equal to b"

When you execute the above program it produces the following result:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - a is not equal to b
2 - a is not equal to b
3 - a is not equal to b
4 - a is not less than b
5 - a is greater than b
6 - a is either less than or equal to b
7 - b is either greater than or equal to b
