# sum of 2 numbers

BEHAVIOR ==> 2,3

# FUNCTIONS

Advantages: - Avoids code duplication ==>
                    Code re-usability
            - When enhancements are required,
                        we need to change code only one place
# Functions:
----------------
f(x) = 2x2+3x+1. Find the value of f(x) when x is 10
f(10) = 2(10*10)+3(10)+1
      = 2(100)+30+1
	  = 200+30+1
f(10) = 231

Find the behavior  of f(x) when x value ranges from -2 to 2
f(-2) = 2(-2*-2)+3(-2)+1  = 3
f(-1) = 2(-1*-1)+3(-1)+1  = 0
f(0)  = 2(0*0)+3(0)+1  	  =	1
f(1)  = 2(1*1)+3(1)+1     = 6
f(2)  = 2(2*2)+3(2)+1     =15

f(x)   = 2x2+3x+1  # Function definition
