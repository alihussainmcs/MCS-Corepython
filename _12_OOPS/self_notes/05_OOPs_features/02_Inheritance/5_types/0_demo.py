XX ==> Only Super class : Animal,Employee : Unnecessarily other behavior also will come to our object

XX ==> Only Sub classes : Code duplication. For example_1 one method is common for all classes,then code

Solution : Use Inheritance 
           Implement classes as Super class - Sub class mechanism
