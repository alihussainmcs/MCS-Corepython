Super class : Common/Generic behavior
Sub class   : Specific behavior wrt sub class


# SC 1 :When few methods are same for all sub classes,
        few are unique for each sub class #1
#1 .Below is the perfect example of using inheritance

                    c1()    d1()     t1()       l1()

#2. Methods ==> Only in Super class : **This is wrong apporach**
    Animal,Employee : Unnecessarily other behavior also will come to our sub class

                           Animal

                  Cat      Dog     Tiger      Lion

#3. Methods ==> ****  This is wrong apporach ****
Only in Sub classes : Code duplication.
For example one method is common for all classes,then code duplication will happen

                  Cat      Dog     Tiger      Lion

# SC 3 :When combination of common,different implementation required

                           Animal
                                eating()    #body

                                sleeping()  #dont give body  (required in unique way)

                  sleeping() sleeping() sleeping() sleeping()   # Method overriding

So solution here is : make sleeping() method as "abstract method" not concrete method
