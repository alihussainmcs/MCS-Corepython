XX ==> Only Super class : Animal,Employee : Unnecessarily other behavior also will come to our object

XX ==> Only Sub classes : Code duplication. For example one method is common for all classes,then code duplication will happen

Solution : Use Inheritance 
           Implement classes as Super class - Sub class mechansim

Here Cat is sub class and Animal is super class. 
Cat as a sub class wil inherit all the features of Animal
Inheritance should be applicable when IS-A *** relationship is satisfied
