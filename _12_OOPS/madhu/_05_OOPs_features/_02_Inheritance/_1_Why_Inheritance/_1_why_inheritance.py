                   Animal

Without inheritance:
---------------------
Tiger, Lion, Cat, Dog

      eating()    eating()           eating()   eating()   # Code duplication

With inheritance:
---------------------
                   Animal
        Tiger   Lion         Cat    Dog 
    
                       Animal
                         eating()            # code re-usability, avoids code duplication

         Tiger        Lion        Cat     Dog 
      
Inheritance => is-a relationship **
Aggregation => has-a relationship  # Controller-Service-DAO layer

Lion is a Animal      - TRUE
Cat is a Animal       - TRUE
Dog is a Animal       - TRUE
SEmployee is a Animal - FALSE
