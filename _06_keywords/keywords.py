Conclusion

Every programming language has special reserved words, or keywords, that have specific meanings and restrictions 
around how they should be used. Python is no different. Python keywords are the fundamental building blocks of any
 Python program.

Identify Python keywords
Understand what each keyword is used for

Python Keywords
Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for anything 
but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you’ll never have to import them into your code.

Python keywords are different from Python’s built-in functions and types. The built-in functions and types are also
 always available, but they are n’t as restrictive as the keywords in their usage.

An example_1 of something you can’t do with Python keywords is assign something to them. If you try, then you’ll
get a SyntaxError. You won’t get a SyntaxError if you try to assign something to a built-in function or type, but
 it still isn’t a good idea. For a more in-depth explanation of ways keywords can be misused, check out Invalid 
 Syntax in Python: Common Reasons for SyntaxError.

As of Python 3.8, there are thirty-five keywords in Python. Here they are with links to the relevant sections 
throughout the rest of this article:

False	await	    else	    import	    pass
None	break	    except	    in	        raise
True	class	    finally	    is	        return
and	    continue	for	        lambda	    try
as	    def	        from	    nonlocal	while
assert	del	        global	    not	        with
async	elif	    if	        or	        yield

Note: Two keywords have additional uses beyond their initial use cases. The else keyword is also used with loops as 
well as with try and except. The as keyword is also used with the with keyword.


How to Identify Python Keywords
The list of Python keywords has changed over time. For example_1, the await and async keywords weren’t added until
Python 3.7. Also, both print and exec were keywords in Python 2.7 but have been turned into built-in functions in 
Python 3+ and no longer appear in the list of keywords.

In the sections below, you’ll learn several ways to know or find out which words are keywords in Python.

Use an IDE With Syntax Highlighting
There are a lot of good Python IDEs out there. All of them will highlight keywords to differentiate them from other
 words in your code. This will help you quickly identify Python keywords while you’re programming so you don’t use
 them incorrectly.

Use Code in a REPL to Check Keywords
In the Python REPL, there are a number of ways you can identify valid Python keywords and learn more about them.

Note: Code examples in this article use Python 3.8 unless otherwise indicated.

You can get a list of available keywords by using help():
"""

help("keywords")

"""

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not
Next, as indicated in the output above, you can use help() again by passing in the specific keyword that you need 
more information about. You can do this, for example_1, with the pass keyword:
"""

help("pass")

"""
The "pass" statement
********************

   pass_stmt ::= "pass"

"pass" is a null operation — when it is executed, nothing happens. It
is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,
but no code needs to be executed, for example_1:

   def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

   class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)
Python also provides a keyword module for working with Python keywords in a programmatic way. The keyword module in
 Python provides two helpful members for dealing with keywords:

kwlist provides a list of all the Python keywords for the version of Python you’re running.
iskeyword() provides a handy way to determine if a string is also a keyword.
To get a list of all the keywords in the version of Python you’re running, and to quickly determine how many
 keywords are defined, use keyword.kwlist:
"""

import keyword

key = keyword.kwlist
print("--------------  Keywords are: ------------------ \n ", key)
"""
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', ...
"""

len(keyword.kwlist)

"""

35
If you need to know more about a keyword or need to work with keywords in a programmatic way, then Python provides 
this documentation and tooling for you.

Look for a SyntaxError
Finally, another indicator that a word you’re using is actually a keyword is if you get a SyntaxError while trying 
to assign to it, name a function with it, or do something else that isn’t allowed with it. This one is a little harder 
to spot, but it’s a way that Python will let you know you’re using a keyword incorrectly.

Python Keywords and Their Usage
The sections below organize the Python keywords into groups based on their usage. For example_1, the first group is 
all the keywords that are used as values, and the second group is the keywords that are used as operators. These 
groupings will help you better understand how keywords are used and provide a nice way to organize the long list 
of Python keywords.

There are a few terms used in the sections below that may be new to you. They’re defined here, and you should be
aware of their meaning before proceeding:

Truthiness refers to the Boolean evaluation of a value. The truthiness of a value indicates whether the value is
 truth or false.

Truthy means any value that evaluates to true in the Boolean context. To determine if a value is truthy, pass 
it as the argument to bool(). If it returns True, then the value is truthy. Examples of truthy values are
 non-empty strings, any numbers that are n’t 0, non-empty lists, and many more.

Falsy means any value that evaluates to false in the Boolean context. To determine if a value is falsy, pass it
 as the argument to bool(). If it returns False, then the value is falsy. Examples of falsy values are "", 
 0, [], {}, and set().

For more on these terms and concepts, check out Operators and Expressions in Python.


Value Keywords: True, False, None
There are three Python keywords that are used as values. These values are singleton values that can be used over
 and over again and always reference the exact same object. You’ll most likely see and use these values a lot.

The True and False Keywords
The True keyword is used as the Boolean true value in Python code. The Python keyword False is similar to the 
True keyword, but with the opposite Boolean value of false. In other programming languages, you’ll see these 
keywords written in lowercase (true and false), but in Python they are always written in uppercase.

The Python keywords True and False can be assigned to variables and compared to directly:
"""

x = True

print(x is True)

# True

y = False
print(y is False)

# True

"""

Most values in Python will evaluate to True when passed to bool(). There are only a few values in Python that
 will evaluate to False when passed to bool(): 0, "", [], and {} to name a few. Passing a value to bool() 
 indicates the value’s truthiness, or the equivalent Boolean value. You can compare a value’s truthiness to
 True or False by passing the value to bool():
"""

x = "this is a truthy value"
print(x is True)

# False
print(bool(x) is True)

# True
y = ""  # This is falsy
print(y is False)

'''
False
'''
print(bool(y) is False)

'''
True
Notice that comparing a truthy value directly to True or False using is doesn’t work. You should directly compare a
 value to True or False only if you want to know whether it is actually the values True or False.

When writing conditional statements that are based on the truthiness of a value, you should not compare directly to 
True or False. You can rely on Python to do the truthiness check in conditionals for you:
'''

x = "this is a truthy value"
if x is True:  # Don't do this
    print("x is True")

if x:  # Do this
    print("x is truthy")

'''
x is truthy

In Python, you generally don’t need to convert values to be explicitly True or False. Python will implicitly 
determine the truthiness of the value for you.

The None Keyword
The Python keyword None represents no value. In other programming languages, None is represented as null, nil, 
none, undef, or undefined.

None is also the default value returned by a function if it doesn’t have a return statement:
'''


def func():
    print("hello")


func()
# hello

print(x)
# None


'''

Python’s NoneType Object.

Operator Keywords: and, or, not, in, is
Several Python keywords are used as operators. In other programming languages, these operators use symbols like 
&, |, and !. The Python operators for these are all keywords:

Math        Operator	Other Languages	    Python Keyword
AND,        ∧	         &&	                and
OR,         ∨	         ||	                or
NOT,        ¬	         !	                not
CONTAINS,   ∈		                        in
IDENTITY	===	                            is
Python code was designed for readability. That’s why many of the operators that use symbols in other programming 
languages are keywords in Python.

The 'and' Keyword
The Python keyword and is used to determine if both the left and right operands are truthy or falsy. If both operands
 are truthy, then the result will be truthy. If one is falsy, then the result will be falsy:

<expr1> and <expr2>
Note that the results of an and statement will not necessarily be True or False. This is because of the quirky behavior 
of and. Rather than evaluating the operands to their Boolean values, and simply returns <expr1> if it is falsy or 
else it returns <expr2>. The results of an and statement could be passed to bool() to get the explicit True or 
False value, or they could be used in a conditional if statement.

If you wanted to define an expression that did the same thing as an and expression, but without using the and 
keyword, then you could use the Python ternary operator:

left if not left else right
The above statement will produce the same result as left and right.

Because and returns the first operand if it’s falsy and otherwise returns the last operand, you can also use and in
 an assignment:

x = y and z
If y is falsy, then this would result in x being assigned the value of y. Otherwise, x would be assigned the value 
of z. However, this makes for confusing code. A more verbose and clear alternative would be:

x = y if not y else z
This code is longer, but it more clearly indicates what you’re trying to accomplish.

The or Keyword
Python’s or keyword is used to determine if at least one of the operands is truthy. An or statement returns the 
first operand if it is truthy and otherwise returns the second operand:

<expr1> or <expr2>
Just like the and keyword, or doesn’t convert its operands to their Boolean values. Instead, it relies on their
 truthiness to determine the results.

If you wanted to write something like an or expression without the use of or, then you could do so with a ternary 
expression:

left if left else right
This expression will produce the same result as left or right. To take advantage of this behavior, you’ll also 
sometimes see or used in assignments. This is generally discouraged in favor of a more explicit assignment.

For a more in-depth look at or and how to use it, check out How to Use the Python or Operator.

The not Keyword
Python’s not keyword is used to get the opposite Boolean value of a variable:

>>> val = ""  # Truthiness value is `False`
>>> not val
True

>>> val = 5  # Truthiness value is `True`
>>> not val
False
The not keyword is used in conditional statements or other Boolean expressions to flip the Boolean meaning or 
result. Unlike and and or, not will determine the explicit Boolean value, True or False, and then return the opposite.

If you wanted to get the same behavior without using not, then you could do so with the following ternary expression:

True if bool(<expr>) is False else False
This statement would return the same result as not <expr>.

The in Keyword
Python’s in keyword is a powerful containment check, or membership operator. Given an element to find and a 
container or sequence to search, in will return True or False indicating whether the element was found in the 
container:

<element> in <container>
A good example_1 of using the in keyword is checking for a specific letter in a string:

>>> name = "Chad"
>>> "c" in name
False
>>> "C" in name
True
The in keyword works with all types of containers: lists, dicts, sets, strings, and anything else that defines 
__contains__() or can be iterated over.

The is Keyword
Python’s is keyword is an identity check. This is different from the == operator, which checks for equality. Sometimes 
two things can be considered equal but not be the exact same object in memory. The is keyword determines whether two 
objects are exactly the same object:

<obj1> is <obj2>
This will return True if <obj1> is the exact same object in memory as <obj2>, or else it will return False.

Most of the time you’ll see is used to check if an object is None. Since None is a singleton, only one instance of 
None that can exist, so all None values are the exact same object in memory.

If these concepts are new to you, then you can get a more in-depth explanation by checking out Python ‘!=’ Is Not ‘is 
not’: Comparing Objects in Python. For a deeper dive into how is works, check out Operators and Expressions in Python.

Control Flow Keywords: if, elif, else
Three Python keywords are used for control flow: if, elif, and else. These Python keywords allow you to use conditional 
logic and execute code given certain conditions. These keywords are very common—they’ll be used in almost every program 
you see or write in Python.

The if Keyword
The if keyword is used to start a conditional statement. An if statement allows you to write a block of code that gets 
executed only if the expression after if is truthy.

The syntax for an if statement starts with the keyword if at the beginning of the line, followed by a valid expression 
that will be evaluated for its truthiness value:

if <expr>:
    <statements>
The if statement is a crucial component of most programs. For more information about the if statement, check out 
Conditional Statements in Python.

Another use of the if keyword is as part of Python’s ternary operator:

<var> = <expr1> if <expr2> else <expr3>
This is a one-line version of the if...else statement below:

if <expr2>:
    <var> = <expr1>
else:
    <var> = <expr3>
If your expressions are uncomplicated statements, then using the ternary expression provides a nice way to simplify 
your code a bit. Once the conditions get a little complex, it’s often better to rely on the standard if statement.

The elif Keyword
The elif statement looks and functions like the if statement, with two major differences:

Using elif is only valid after an if statement or another elif.
You can use as many elif statements as you need.
In other programming languages, elif is either else if (two separate words) or elseif (both words mashed together). 
When you see elif in Python, think else if:

if <expr1>:
    <statements>
elif <expr2>:
    <statements>
elif <expr3>:
    <statements>
Python doesn’t have a switch statement. One way to get the same functionality that other programming languages provide 
with switch statements is by using if and elif. For other ways of reproducing the switch statement in Python, check out 
Emulating switch/case Statements in Python.

The else Keyword The else statement, in conjunction with the Python keywords if and elif, denotes a block of code 
that should be executed only if the other conditional blocks, if and elif, are all falsy: 

if <expr>: <statements> else: <statements> Notice that the else statement doesn’t take a conditional expression. 
Knowledge of the elif and else keywords and their proper usage is critical for Python programmers. Together with if, 
they make up some of the most frequently used components in any Python program. 


 Remove ads Iteration Keywords: for, while, break, continue, else Looping and iteration are hugely important 
 programming concepts. Several Python keywords are used to create and work with loops. These, like the Python 
 keywords used for conditionals above, will be used and seen in just about every Python program you come across. 
 Understanding them and their proper usage will help you improve as a Python programmer. 

The for Keyword The most common loop in Python is the for loop. It’s constructed by combining the Python keywords for 
and in explained earlier. The basic syntax for a for loop is as follows: 

for <element> in <container>:
    <statements>
A common example_1 is looping over the numbers one through five and printing them to the screen:

>>> for num in range(1, 6):
...     print(num)
...
1
2
3
4
5
In other programming languages, the syntax for a for loop will look a little different. You’ll often need to specify the 
variable, the condition for continuing, and the way to increment that variable (for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)).

In Python, the for loop is like a for-each loop in other programming languages. Given the object to iterate over, it 
assigns the value of each iteration to the variable:

>>> people = ["Kevin", "Creed", "Jim"]
>>> for person in people:
...     print(f"{person} was in The Office.")
...
Kevin was in The Office.
Creed was in The Office.
Jim was in The Office.
In this example_1, you start with the list (container) of people’s names. The for loop starts with the for keyword at 
the beginning of the line, followed by the variable to assign each element of the list to, then the in keyword, and 
finally the container (people).

Python’s for loop is another major ingredient in any Python program. To learn more about for loops, check out Python 
“for” Loops (Definite Iteration).

The while Keyword
Python’s while loop uses the keyword while and works like a while loop in other programming languages. As long as the 
condition that follows the while keyword is truthy, the block following the while statement will continue to be executed 
over and over again:

while <expr>:
    <statements>
Note: For the infinite loop example_1 below, be prepared to use Ctrl+C to stop the process if you decide to try it on 
your own machine.

The easiest way to specify an infinite loop in Python is to use the while keyword with an expression that is always 
truthy:

>>> while True:
...     print("working...")
...
For more examples of infinite loops in action, check out Socket Programming in Python (Guide). To learn more about while 
loops, check out Python “while” Loops (Indefinite Iteration).

The break Keyword
If you need to exit a loop early,then you can use the break keyword. This keyword will work in both for and while loops:

for <element> in <container>:
    if <expr>:
        break
An example_1 of using the break keyword would be if you were summing the integers in a list of numbers and wanted to 
quit when the total went above a given value:

>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> sum = 0
>>> for num in nums:
...     sum += num
...     if sum > 10:
...         break
...
>>> sum
15
Both the Python keywords break and continue can be useful tools when working with loops. For a deeper discussion of 
their uses, check out Python “while” Loops (Indefinite Iteration).

The continue Keyword
Python also has a continue keyword for when you want to skip to the next loop iteration. Like in most other programming 
languages, the continue keyword allows you to stop executing the current loop iteration and move on to the next 
iteration:

for <element> in <container>:
    if <expr>:
        continue
The continue keyword also works in while loops. If the continue keyword is reached in a loop, then the current iteration 
is stopped, and the next iteration of the loop is started.

The else Keyword Used With Loops
In addition to using the else keyword with conditional if statements, you can also use it as part of a loop. When used 
with a loop, the else keyword specifies code that should be run if the loop exits normally, meaning break was not called 
to exit the loop early.

The syntax for using else with a for loop looks like the following:

for <element> in <container>:
    <statements>
else:
    <statements>
This is very similar to using else with an if statement. Using else with a while loop looks similar:

while <expr>:
    <statements>
else:
    <statements>
The Python standard documentation has a section on using break and else with a for loop that you should really check 
out. It uses a great example_1 to illustrate the usefulness of the else block.

The task it shows is looping over the numbers two through nine to find the prime numbers. One way you could do this is 
with a standard for loop with a flag variable:

>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     prime = True
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             prime = False
...             print(f"{n} is not prime")
...             break
...     if prime:
...         print(f"{n} is prime!")
...
2 is prime!
3 is prime!
4 is not prime
5 is prime!
6 is not prime
7 is prime!
8 is not prime
9 is not prime
You can use the prime flag to indicate how the loop was exited. If it exited normally, then the prime flag stays True. 
If it exited with break, then the prime flag will be set to False. Once outside the inner for loop, you can check the 
flag to determine if prime is True and, if so, print that the number is prime.

The else block provides more straightforward syntax. If you find yourself having to set a flag in a loop, then consider 
the next example_1 as a way to potentially simplify your code:

>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(f"{n} is not prime")
...             break
...     else:
...         print(f"{n} is prime!")
...
2 is prime!
3 is prime!
4 is not prime
5 is prime!
6 is not prime
7 is prime!
8 is not prime
9 is not prime
The only thing that you need to do to use the else block in this example_1 is to remove the prime flag and replace the 
final if statement with the else block. This ends up producing the same result as the example_1 before, only with 
clearer code.

Sometimes using an else keyword with a loop can seem a little strange, but once you understand that it allows you to 
avoid using flags in your loops, it can be a powerful tool.

Structure Keywords: def, class, with, as, pass, lambda
In order to define functions and classes or use context managers, you’ll need to use one of the Python keywords in this
 section. They’re an essential part of the Python language, and understanding when to use them will help you become a 
 better Python programmer.

The def Keyword
Python’s keyword def is used to define a function or method of a class. This is equivalent to function in JavaScript 
and PHP. The basic syntax for defining a function with def looks like this:

def <function>(<params>):
    <body>
Functions and methods can be very helpful structures in any Python program. To learn more about defining them and all 
their ins and outs, check out Defining Your Own Python Function.

The class Keyword
To define a class in Python, you use the class keyword. The general syntax for defining a class with class is as 
follows:

class MyClass(<extends>):
    <body>
Classes are powerful tools in object-oriented programming, and you should know about them and how to define them. To 
learn more, check out Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3.

The with Keyword
Context managers are a really helpful structure in Python. Each context manager executes specific code before and after 
the statements you specify. To use one, you use the with keyword:

with <context manager> as <var>:
    <statements>
Using with gives you a way to define code to be executed within the context manager’s scope. The most basic example_1 
of this is when you’re working with file I/O in Python.

If you wanted to open a file, do something with that file, and then make sure that the file was closed correctly, then 
you would use a context manager. Consider this example_1 in which names.txt contains a list of names, one per line:

>>> with open("names.txt") as input_file:
...    for name in input_file:
...        print(name.strip())
...
Jim
Pam
Cece
Philip
The file I/O context manager provided by open() and initiated with the with keyword opens the file for reading, assigns 
the open file pointer to input_file, then executes whatever code you specify in the with block. Then, after the block is 
executed, the file pointer closes. Even if your code in the with block raises an exception, the file pointer would 
still close.

For a great example_1 of using with and context managers, check out Python Timer Functions: Three Ways to Monitor Your 
Code.

The as Keyword Used With with
If you want access to the results of the expression or context manager passed to with, you’ll need to alias it using as. 
You may have also seen as used to alias imports and exceptions, and this is no different. The alias is available in the 
with block:

with <expr> as <alias>:
    <statements>
Most of the time, you’ll see these two Python keywords, with and as, used together.

The pass Keyword
Since Python doesn’t have block indicators to specify the end of a block, the pass keyword is used to specify that the
 block is intentionally left blank. It’s the equivalent of a no-op, or no operation. Here are a few examples of using 
 pass to specify that the block is blank:

def my_function():
    pass

class MyClass:
    pass

if True:
    pass
For more on pass, check out The pass Statement: How to Do Nothing in Python.

The lambda Keyword
The lambda keyword is used to define a function that doesn’t have a name and has only one statement, the results of 
which are returned. Functions defined with lambda are referred to as lambda functions:

lambda <args>: <statement>
A basic example_1 of a lambda function that computes the argument raised to the power of 10 would look like this:

p10 = lambda x: x**10
This is equivalent to defining a function with def:

def p10(x):
    return x**10
One common use for a lambda function is specifying a different behavior for another function. For example_1, imagine you 
wanted to sort a list of strings by their integer values. The default behavior of sorted() would sort the strings 
alphabetically. But with sorted(), you can specify which key the list should be sorted on.

A lambda function provides a nice way to do so:

>>> ids = ["id1", "id2", "id30", "id3", "id20", "id10"]
>>> sorted(ids)
['id1', 'id10', 'id2', 'id20', 'id3', 'id30']

>>> sorted(ids, key=lambda x: int(x[2:]))
['id1', 'id2', 'id3', 'id10', 'id20', 'id30']
This example_1 sorts the list based not on alphabetical order but on the numerical order of the last characters of the 
strings after converting them to integers. Without lambda, you would have had to define a function, give it a name, and 
then pass it to sorted(). lambda made this code cleaner.

For comparison, this is what the example_1 above would look like without using lambda:

>>> def sort_by_int(x):
...     return int(x[2:])
...
>>> ids = ["id1", "id2", "id30", "id3", "id20", "id10"]
>>> sorted(ids, key=sort_by_int)
['id1', 'id2', 'id3', 'id10', 'id20', 'id30']
This code produces the same result as the lambda example_1, but you need to define the function before using it.

Returning Keywords: return, yield
There are two Python keywords used to specify what gets returned from functions or methods: return and yield. 
Understanding when and where to use return is vital to becoming a better Python programmer. The yield keyword is a 
more advanced feature of Python, but it can also be a useful tool to understand.

The return Keyword
Python’s return keyword is valid only as part of a function defined with def. When Python encounters this keyword, it 
will exit the function at that point and return the results of whatever comes after the return keyword:

def <function>():
    return <expr>
When given no expression, return will return None by default:

>>> def return_none():
...     return
...
>>> return_none()
>>> r = return_none()
>>> print(r)
None
Most of the time, however, you want to return the results of an expression or a specific value:

>>> def plus_1(num):
...    return num + 1
...
>>> plus_1(9)
10
>>> r = plus_1(9)
>>> print(r)
10
You can even use the return keyword multiple times in a function. This allows you to have multiple exit points in your 
function. A classic example_1 of when you would want to have multiple return statements is the following recursive 
solution to calculating factorial:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
In the factorial function above, there are two cases in which you would want to return from the function. The first is 
the base case, when the number is 1, and the second is the regular case, when you want to multiply the current number by 
the next number’s factorial value.

To learn more about the return keyword, check out Defining Your Own Python Function.

The yield Keyword
Python’s yield keyword is kind of like the return keyword in that it specifies what gets returned from a function. 
However, when a function has a yield statement, what gets returned is a generator. The generator can then be passed to 
Python’s built-in next() to get the next value returned from the function.

When you call a function with yield statements, Python executes the function until it reaches the first yield keyword 
and then returns a generator. These are known as generator functions:

def <function>():
    yield <expr>
The most straightforward example_1 of this would be a generator function that returns the same set of values:

>>> def family():
...     yield "Pam"
...     yield "Jim"
...     yield "Cece"
...     yield "Philip"
...
>>> names = family()
>>> names
<generator object family at 0x7f47a43577d8>
>>> next(names)
'Pam'
>>> next(names)
'Jim'
>>> next(names)
'Cece'
>>> next(names)
'Philip'
>>> next(names)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
Once the StopIteration exception is raised, the generator is done returning values. In order to go through the names 
again, you would need to call family() again and get a new generator. Most of the time, a generator function will be 
called as part of a for loop, which does the next() calls for you.

yield in Python and Python Generators 101.

Import Keywords: import, from, as
For those tools that, unlike Python keywords and built-ins, are not already available to your Python program, you’ll 
need to import them into your program. There are many useful modules available in Python’s standard library that are 
only an import away. There are also many other useful libraries and tools available in PyPI that, once you’ve installed 
them into your environment, you’ll need to import into your programs.

The following are brief descriptions of the three Python keywords used for importing modules into your program. For more 
information about these keywords, check out Python Modules and Packages – An Introduction and Python import: Advanced 
Techniques and Tips.

The import Keyword
Python’s import keyword is used to import, or include, a module for use in your Python program. Basic usage syntax looks 
like this:

import <module>
After that statement runs, the <module> will be available to your program.

For example_1, if you want to use the Counter class from the collections module in the standard library, then you can 
use the following code:

>>> import collections
>>> collections.Counter()
Counter()
Importing collections in this way makes the whole collections module, including the Counter class, available to your
program. By using the module name, you have access to all the tools available in that module. To get access to Counter, 
you reference it from the module: collections.Counter.

The from Keyword
The from keyword is used together with import to import something specific from a module:

from <module> import <thing>
This will import whatever <thing> is inside <module> to be used inside your program. These two Python keywords, from 
and import, are used together.

If you want to use Counter from the collections module in the standard library, then you can import it specifically:

>>> from collections import Counter
>>> Counter()
Counter()
Importing Counter like this makes the Counter class available, but nothing else from the collections module is 
available. Counter is now available without you having to reference it from the collections module.

The as Keyword
The as keyword is used to alias an imported module or tool. It’s used together with the Python keywords import and from 
to change the name of the thing being imported:

import <module> as <alias>
from <module> import <thing> as <alias>
For modules that have really long names or a commonly used import alias, as can be helpful in creating the alias.

If you want to import the Counter class from the collections module but name it something different, you can alias it 
by using as: 

>>> from collections import Counter as C >>> C() Counter() Now Counter is available to be used in your program, 
but it’s referenced by C instead. A more common use of as import aliases is with NumPy or Pandas packages. These are 
commonly imported with standard aliases: 

import numpy as np import pandas as pd This is a better alternative to just importing everything from a module, 
and it allows you to shorten the name of the module being imported.

Exception-Handling Keywords: try, except, raise, finally, else, assert
One of the most common aspects of any Python program is the raising and catching of exceptions. Because this is such a 
fundamental aspect of all Python code, there are several Python keywords available to help make this part of your code 
clear and concise.

The sections below go over these Python keywords and their basic usage. For a more in-depth tutorial on these keywords,
 check out Python Exceptions: An Introduction.

The try Keyword
Any exception-handling block begins with Python’s try keyword. This is the same in most other programming languages 
that have exception handling.

The code in the try block is code that might raise an exception. Several other Python keywords are associated with try 
and are used to define what should be done if different exceptions are raised or in different situations. These are 
except, else, and finally:

try:
    <statements>
<except|else|finally>:
    <statements>
A try block isn’t valid unless it has at least one of the other Python keywords used for exception handling as part of 
the overall try statement.

If you wanted to calculate and return the miles per gallon of gas (mpg) given the miles driven and the gallons of gas 
used, then you could write a function like the following:

def mpg(miles, gallons):
    return miles / gallons
The first problem you might see is that your code could raise a ZeroDivisionError if the gallons parameter is passed in 
as 0. The try keyword allows you to modify the code above to handle that situation appropriately:

def mpg(miles, gallons):
    try:
        mpg = miles / gallons
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        mpg = None
    return mpg
Now if gallons = 0, then mpg() won’t raise an exception and will return None instead. This might be better, or you 
might decide that you want to raise a different type of exception or handle this situation differently. You’ll see an 
expanded version of this example_1 below to illustrate the other keywords used for exception handling.

The except Keyword
Python’s except keyword is used with try to define what to do when specific exceptions are raised. You can have one or 
more except blocks with a single try. The basic usage looks like this:

try:
    <statements>
except <exception>:
    <statements>
Taking the mpg() example_1 from before, you could also do something specific in the event that someone passes types that 
won’t work with the / operator. Having defined mpg() in a previous example_1, now try to call it with strings instead 
of numbers:

>>> mpg("lots", "many")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in mpg
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
You could revise mpg() and use multiple except blocks to handle this situation, too:

def mpg(miles, gallons):
    try:
        mpg = miles / gallons
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        mpg = None
    except TypeError as ex:
        print("you need to provide numbers")
        raise ex
    return mpg
Here, you modify mpg() to raise the TypeError exception only after you’ve printed a helpful reminder to the screen.

Notice that the except keyword can also be used in conjunction with the as keyword. This has the same effect as the 
other uses of as, giving the raised exception an alias so you can work with it in the except block.

Even though it’s syntactically allowed, try not to use except statements as implicit catchalls. It’s better practice to 
always explicitly catch something, even if it’s just Exception:

try:
    1 / 0
except:  # Don't do this
    pass

try:
    1 / 0
except Exception:  # This is better
    pass

try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:  # This is best
    pass
If you really do want to catch a broad range of exceptions, then specify the parent Exception. This is more explicitly 
a catchall, and it won’t also catch exceptions you probably don’t want to catch, like RuntimeError or KeyboardInterrupt.

The raise Keyword
The raise keyword raises an exception. If you find you need to raise an exception, then you can use raise followed by 
the exception to be raised:

raise <exception>
You used raise previously, in the mpg() example_1. When you catch the TypeError, you re-raise the exception after 
printing a message to the screen.

The finally Keyword
Python’s finally keyword is helpful for specifying code that should be run no matter what happens in the try, except, 
or else blocks. To use finally, use it as part of a try block and specify the statements that should be run no 
matter what:

try:
    <statements>
finally:
    <statements>
Using the example_1 from before, it might be helpful to specify that, no matter what happens, you want to know what 
arguments the function was called with. You could modify mpg() to include a finally block that does just that:

def mpg(miles, gallons):
    try:
        mpg = miles / gallons
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        mpg = None
    except TypeError as ex:
        print("you need to provide numbers")
        raise ex
    finally:
        print(f"mpg({miles}, {gallons})")
    return mpg
Now, no matter how mpg() is called or what the result is, you print the arguments supplied by the user:

>>> mpg(10, 1)
mpg(10, 1)
10.0

>>> mpg("lots", "many")
you need to provide numbers
mpg(lots, many)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 8, in mpg
  File "<stdin>", line 3, in mpg
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
The finally keyword can be a very useful part of your exception-handling code.

The else Keyword Used With try and except
You’ve learned that the else keyword can be used with both the if keyword and loops in Python, but it has one more use. 
It can be combined with the try and except Python keywords. You can use else in this way only if you also use at least 
one except block:

try:
    <statements>
except <exception>:
    <statements>
else:
    <statements>
In this context, the code in the else block is executed only if an exception was not raised in the try block. In other 
words, if the try block executed all the code successfully, then the else block code would be executed.

In the mpg() example_1, imagine you want to make sure that the mpg result is always returned as a float no matter what 
number combination is passed in. One of the ways you could do this is to use an else block. If the try block calculation 
of mpg is successful, then you convert the result to a float in the else block before returning:

def mpg(miles, gallons):
    try:
        mpg = miles / gallons
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        mpg = None
    except TypeError as ex:
        print("you need to provide numbers")
        raise ex
    else:
        mpg = float(mpg) if mpg is not None else mpg
    finally:
        print(f"mpg({miles}, {gallons})")
    return mpg
Now the results of a call to mpg(), if successful, will always be a float.

For more on using the else block as part of a try and except block, check out Python Exceptions: An Introduction.

The assert Keyword
The assert keyword in Python is used to specify an assert statement, or an assertion about an expression. An assert 
statement will result in a no-op if the expression (<expr>) is truthy, and it will raise an AssertionError if the 
expression is falsy. To define an assertion, use assert followed by an expression:

assert <expr>
Generally, assert statements will be used to make sure something that needs to be true is. You should n’t rely on them, 
however, as they can be ignored depending on how your Python program is executed.

Asynchronous Programming Keywords: async, await
Asynchronous programming is a complex topic. There are two Python keywords defined to help make asynchronous code more 
readable and cleaner: async and await.

The sections below introduce the two asynchronous keywords and their basic syntax, but they won’t go into depth on 
asynchronous programming. To learn more about asynchronous programming, check out Async IO in Python: A Complete 
Walk through and Getting Started With Async Features in Python.

The async Keyword
The async keyword is used with def to define an asynchronous function, or coroutine. The syntax is just like defining a 
function, with the addition of async at the beginning:

async def <function>(<params>):
    <statements>
You can make a function asynchronous by adding the async keyword before the function’s regular definition.

The await Keyword
Python’s await keyword is used in asynchronous functions to specify a point in the function where control is given back 
to the event loop for other functions to run. You can use it by placing the await keyword in front of a call to any 
async function:

await <some async function call>
# OR
<var> = await <some async function call>
When using await, you can either call the asynchronous function and ignore the results, or you can store the results in 
a variable when the function eventually returns.

Variable Handling Keywords: del, global, nonlocal
Three Python keywords are used to work with variables. The del keyword is much more commonly used than the global and 
nonlocal keywords. But it’s still helpful to know and understand all three keywords so you can identify when and how 
to use them.

The del Keyword
del is used in Python to unset a variable or name. You can use it on variable names, but a more common use is to remove 
indexes from a list or dictionary. To unset a variable, use del followed by the variable you want to unset:

del <variable>
Let’s assume you want to clean up a dictionary that you got from an API response by throwing out keys you know you 
won’t use. You can do so with the del keyword:

>>> del response["headers"]
>>> del response["errors"]
This will remove the "headers" and "errors" keys from the dictionary response.

The global Keyword
If you need to modify a variable that isn’t defined in a function but is defined in the global scope, then you’ll need 
to use the global keyword. This works by specifying in the function which variables need to be pulled into the function 
from the global scope:

global <variable>
A basic example_1 is incrementing a global variable with a function call. You can do that with the global keyword:

>>> x = 0
>>> def inc():
...     global x
...     x += 1
...
>>> inc()
>>> x
1
>>> inc()
>>> x
2
This is generally not considered good practice, but it does have its uses. To learn much more on the global keyword, 
check out Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code.

The nonlocal Keyword
The nonlocal keyword is similar to global in that it allows you to modify variables from a different scope. With global, 
the scope you’re pulling from is the global scope. With nonlocal, the scope you’re pulling from is the parent scope. The 
syntax is similar to global:

nonlocal <variable>
This keyword isn’t used very often, but it can be handy at times. For more on scoping and the nonlocal keyword, check 
out Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code.

Deprecated Python Keywords
Sometimes a Python keyword becomes a built-in function. That was the case with both print and exec. These used to be 
Python keywords in version 2.7, but they’ve since been changed to built-in functions.

The Former print Keyword
When print was a keyword, the syntax to print something to the screen looked like this:

print "Hello, World"
Notice that it looks like a lot of the other keyword statements, with the keyword followed by the arguments.

Now print is no longer a keyword, and printing is accomplished with the built-in print(). To print something to the 
screen, you now use the following syntax:

print("Hello, World")
For more on printing, check out Your Guide to the Python print() Function.

The Former exec Keyword
In Python 2.7, the exec keyword took Python code as a string and executed it. This was done with the following syntax:

exec "<statements>"
You can get the same behavior in Python 3+, only with the built-in exec(). For example_1, if you wanted to execute 
"x = 12 * 7" in your Python code, then you could do the following:

>>> exec("x = 12 * 7")
>>> x == 84
True
For more on exec() and its uses, check out How to Run Your Python Scripts.
