Hash Table
The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where

Key- unique integer that is used for indexing the values
Value - data that are associated with keys.
Hash Table key and data
Key and Value in Hash table
Hashing (Hash Function)
In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the
index. This process is called hashing.

Let k be a key and h(x) be a hash function.

Here, h(k) will give us a new index to store the element linked with k.

Hash table Representation

Hash Collision
When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will be a conflict (what value to be stored in
that index). This is called a hash collision.

We can resolve the hash collision using one of the following techniques.

Collision resolution by chaining
Open Addressing: Linear/Quadratic Probing and Double Hashing
1. Collision resolution by chaining
In chaining, if a hash function produces the same index for multiple elements, these elements are stored in the same
index by using a doubly-linked list.

If j is the slot for multiple elements, it contains a pointer to the head of the list of elements. If no element is
present, j contains NIL.

chaining method used to resolve collision in hash table
Collision Resolution using chaining
Pseudocode for operations

chainedHashSearch(T, k)
  return T[h(k)]
chainedHashInsert(T, x)
  T[h(x.key)] = x //insert at the head
chainedHashDelete(T, x)
  T[h(x.key)] = NIL
2. Open Addressing
Unlike chaining, open addressing doesn't store multiple elements into the same slot. Here, each slot is either filled
with a single key or left NIL.

Different techniques used in open addressing are:

i. Linear Probing
In linear probing, collision is resolved by checking the next slot.

h(k, i) = (h′(k) + i) mod m

where

i = {0, 1, ….}
h'(k) is a new hash function
If a collision occurs at h(k, 0), then h(k, 1) is checked. In this way, the value of i is incremented linearly.


The problem with linear probing is that a cluster of adjacent slots is filled. When inserting a new element, the entire
cluster must be traversed. This adds to the time required to perform operations on the hash table.

ii. Quadratic Probing
It works similar to linear probing but the spacing between the slots is increased (greater than one) by using the
following relation.

h(k, i) = (h′(k) + c1i + c2i2) mod m

where,

c1 and c2 are positive auxiliary constants,
i = {0, 1, ….}
iii. Double hashing
If a collision occurs after applying a hash function h(k), then another hash function is calculated for finding the
next slot.

h(k, i) = (h1(k) + ih2(k)) mod m

Good Hash Functions
A good hash function may not prevent the collisions completely however it can reduce the number of collisions.

Here, we will look into different methods to find a good hash function

1. Division Method
If k is a key and m is the size of the hash table, the hash function h() is calculated as:

h(k) = k mod m

For example, If the size of a hash table is 10 and k = 112 then h(k) = 112 mod 10 = 2. The value of m must not be the
powers of 2. This is because the powers of 2 in binary format are 10, 100, 1000, …. When we find k mod m, we will always
get the lower order p-bits.

if m = 22, k = 17, then h(k) = 17 mod 22 = 10001 mod 100 = 01
if m = 23, k = 17, then h(k) = 17 mod 22 = 10001 mod 100 = 001
if m = 24, k = 17, then h(k) = 17 mod 22 = 10001 mod 100 = 0001
if m = 2p, then h(k) = p lower bits of m
2. Multiplication Method
h(k) = ⌊m(kA mod 1)⌋

where,

kA mod 1 gives the fractional part kA,
⌊ ⌋ gives the floor value
A is any constant. The value of A lies between 0 and 1. But, an optimal choice will be ≈ (√5-1)/2 suggested by Knuth.
3. Universal Hashing
In Universal hashing, the hash function is chosen at random independent of keys.
