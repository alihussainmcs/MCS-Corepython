Decrease Key and Delete Node Operations on a Fibonacci Heap
In this tutorial, you will learn how decrease key and delete node operations work. Also, you will find working examples
of these operations on a fibonacci heap in C, C++, Java and Python.

A fibonacci heap is a tree based data structure which consists of a collection of trees with min heap or max heap
property. Its operations are more efficient in terms of time complexity than those of its similar data structures like
binomial heap and binary heap.

Now, we will discuss two of its important operations.

Decrease a key: decreases the value of a the key to any lower value
Delete a node: deletes the given node
Decreasing a Key
In decreasing a key operation, the value of a key is decreased to a lower value.


Following functions are used for decreasing the key.

Decrease-Key
Select the node to be decreased, x, and change its value to the new value k.
If the parent of x, y, is not null and the key of parent is greater than that of the k then call Cut(x) and
    Cascading-Cut(y) subsequently.
If the key of x is smaller than the key of min, then mark x as min.
Cut
Remove x from the current position and add it to the root list.
If x is marked, then mark it as false.
Cascading-Cut
If the parent of y is not null then follow the following steps.
If y is unmarked, then mark y.
Else, call Cut(y) and Cascading-Cut(parent of y).


Deleting a Node
This process makes use of decrease-key and extract-min operations. The following steps are followed for deleting a node.

Let k be the node to be deleted.
Apply decrease-key operation to decrease the value of k to the lowest possible value (i.e. -âˆž).
Apply extract-min operation to remove this node.
