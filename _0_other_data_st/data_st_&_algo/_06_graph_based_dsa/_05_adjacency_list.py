Adjacency List

An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and each
    element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

For example, we have a graph below.


                        0 -----3
                        | \
                        |   2
                        |  /
                         1

                    An undirected graph


We can represent this graph in the form of a linked list on a computer as shown below.

                        0 -----3              0  -->  1  -->  2  -->  3
                        | \                   1  -->  0  -->  2
                        |   2                 2  -->  0  -->  1
                        |  /                  3  -->  0
                         1


                        Adjacency list representation


Here, 0, 1, 2, 3 are the vertices and each of them forms a linked list with all of its adjacent vertices. For instance,
    vertex 1 has two adjacent vertices 0 and 2. Therefore, 1 is linked with 0 and 2 in the figure above.


Pros of Adjacency List

An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For a sparse
    graph with millions of vertices and edges, this can mean a lot of saved space.
It also helps to find all the vertices adjacent to a vertex easily.


Cons of Adjacency List
Finding the adjacent list is not quicker than the adjacency matrix because all the connected nodes must be first
    explored to find them.
Adjacency List Structure
The simplest adjacency list needs a node data structure to store a vertex and a graph data structure to organize
    the nodes.

We stay close to the basic definition of a graph - a collection of vertices and edges {V, E}. For simplicity, we use an
    unlabeled graph as opposed to a labeled one i.e. the vertices are identified by their indices 0,1,2,3.

Let's dig into the data structures at play here.

struct node{
    int vertex;
    struct node* next;
};

struct Graph{
    int numVertices;
    struct node** adjLists;
};

Don't let the struct node** adjLists overwhelm you.

All we are saying is we want to store a pointer to struct node*. This is because we don't know how many vertices the
    graph will have and so we cannot create an array of Linked Lists at compile time.


Adjacency List Python
There is a reason Python gets so much love. A simple dictionary of vertices and its edges is a sufficient representation
    of a graph. You can make the vertex itself as complex as you want.

graph = {'A': set(['B', 'C']),
         'B': set(['A', 'D', 'E']),
         'C': set(['A', 'F']),
         'D': set(['B']),
         'E': set(['B', 'F']),
         'F': set(['C', 'E'])}
